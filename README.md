# Crop Disease Prediction and Management System
## Smart India Hackathon 2024
`This project is still under development, and not all features have been added yet.`

## Description
- Developed an advanced Crop Disease Predictor Web App using **AI-powered image recognition**.
- Implemented a **deep learning model - CNN** using TensorFlow and Keras for accurate disease identification.
- Built a Flask server backend to handle image uploads and deliver real-time disease predictions.
- Supports identification of various crop diseases across multiple plant species.
- Working on building the managment system for all the crops.
